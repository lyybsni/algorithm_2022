Find a longest common subsequence of two strings.

*Input*: Strings s and t.

*Output*: A longest common subsequence of s and t.

A string is a subsequence of a string s if it can be obtained by deleting some symbols from s. For example, GC and GAT are both subsequences of GACT. A string x is a common subsequence of strings s and t if it is a subsequence of both s and t. For example, G and AT are both common subsequences of GACT and ATG. Our goal is to find a longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings. Note that two strings may have more than one longest common subsequence.

*Input Format*. The first line of the input contains a string s, and the second line of the input contains a string t.

*Output Format*. A longest common subsequence of s and t. (Note: you can output any of the solutions.)


*Constraints*. |s| ≤ 1,000; |t| ≤ 1,000
